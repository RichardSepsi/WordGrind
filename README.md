# WordGrind　・　言葉作業ゲー
A simple web app for memorizing words.
## How does it work
A random word gets picked up from a deck and you need to provide an answer.
If your answer is correct a different word is picked, if not, then you can show the correct answer by clicking the button or hitting enter.
## Notes
While core functionality is finished, the app is still work in progress and things like stats, in app editing of decks and options don't work.
For now it's only possible to customize decks by modifying the "rawjson" variable in script.js.
English version is not yet available, but might be in the future.
